#External DNS:
--------------
- External DNS is a tool that automatically manages DNS records for Kubernetes resources.
- It supports multiple DNS providers such as AWS Route 53, Google Cloud DNS, Cloudflare, and others.
- External DNS watches Kubernetes resources like Services and Ingresses and creates or updates DNS records based on the resource specifications.
- It helps in automating the process of DNS management, reducing manual intervention and potential errors.  
- External DNS can be configured using command-line flags or environment variables to specify the DNS provider, domain filters, and other settings.
- It is commonly deployed as a pod within the Kubernetes cluster, often using a Deployment or DaemonSet.
- External DNS requires appropriate permissions to manage DNS records, which can be provided through cloud provider IAM roles or service accounts.
- It is important to monitor External DNS logs and metrics to ensure it is functioning correctly and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
- External DNS can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines to automate DNS record management as part of application deployment processes.
- For more information and configuration options, refer to the official External DNS documentation: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns
